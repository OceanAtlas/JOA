 * @note Keeps list of salient information about each contour that is 
  * displayed in the view.  This list is kept so contours can be 
  * removed, and to generate a secondary popup that appears when 
  * "activateContour" is selected from the primary popup menu.  May 
  * use the ContourFactory to get a contour, and the 
  * ContourRenderer to render it.  May supply information to the 
  * liveWire activator if necessary.
